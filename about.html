                    <h1>What is La-Tomatina?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Its a festival where thousands of people throws tomato to one another in a town called Buñol localted in Spain. 
                        Its the biggest official tomato street fight in the world where tourist from all around the globe attends. The events is always held on the last wednesdat in the month of August. 
                        Many people have many different opinion regarding this festival as it is a bit weird, unusual and it is certainly fun. In modern times, wasting foodstuff to such an extend is considered quite insane.
                        Even if though the tomatoes thrown aren't edible it is still regarded as wasting foodstuff since it is tomatoes grown from crops that is treated differently from those used for food and are exclusively
                        grown for the festival, said Buñol Deputy Mayor Sergio Galarza. Without the festival La-Tomatina these tomatoes wouldn't be cultivated because there would not be and need for them.

                    <h1>What is the festival about?</h1>
                    <p>
                        The festival is in honor of the town’s patron saints, Luis Bertran and the Mare de Deu dels Desemparats (Mother of God of the Defenseless), a title of the Virgin Mary. 
                        At around 11am many trucks haul the bounty of tomatoes into the centre of the town. The tomatoes come from Extremadura, where they  are less expensive. Technically the 
                        festival does not begin until one brave soul has climbed to the top of a two-story high, greased-up wooden pole and reached the coveted ham at the top. In practice this 
                        process takes a long time and the festival starts despite no one reaching the meaty prize. The signal for the beginning of the fight is firing of water cannons, and the 
                        chaos begins. After an one hour the fighting ends. At this point, no more tomatoes can be thrown. The cleaning process involves the use of fire trucks to spray down the 
                        streets, with water provided from a Roman aqueduct.

                    <h1>Rules of La-Tomatina.</h1>
                    <p>
                        There are no teams, no points and no referees, but there is a guideline: To avoid injuries, participants are encouraged to squash the tomatoes before hurling them.
                        During the festival people are advised to wear olden clothes due to how worn out it will be although the rules also stated that other peoples are not allowed to rip each others shirts.
                        Hard objects and hard bottles are not permitted to carry around during the festivals as it may cause accisents and hurt other participants. The food fight stops as soon as the second shot of the water cannons
                        can be heard and participants are expected to stop throwing tomatoes although it is different in reality.
