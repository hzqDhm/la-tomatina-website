                <p>
                    Life in Buñol at the time, like much of Spain in the aftermath of the 
                    Spanish Civil War, was marked by political repression, economic hardship and 
                    the sweeping rollback of social and political progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    it was the last Wednesday of August 1945 when a group of local boys showed up at 
                    Buñol’s town square for a traditional parade of “giants and big heads” honoring the 
                    town’s patron saint. Tensions were already simmering: The town council had chosen 
                    one group of boys to carry the parade paraphernalia, while rejecting another. These 
                    boys belonged to the latter. According to the oral history, Yxeres and Chornet write, 
                    one youth may have shoved one of the towering papier-mâché figures in protest, prompting 
                    another to snatch a tomato from a nearby market stall and hurl it. The ensuing food fight 
                    lasted until police intervened. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although authorities canceled the parade the next year to prevent another food fight, the 
                    group of boys returned anyway, armed with tomatoes. “They brought tomatoes from home and repeated 
                    the experience year after year until one year, the council provided a lorry with tomatoes, and it 
                    became a very famous celebration,” Zanón said.

                <p>
                    The festival was officially banned in 1957. In the spirit of defiance in which the festival originated, 
                    locals continued to participate, even in the face of arrest. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To protest the ban, townspeople staged an event that was both satirical and symbolic: a mock tomato funeral. 
                    “The whole town, including my dad, dressed in mourning,” Zanón told the BBC. “They were all wearing black. They 
                    had the hats that people used to wear when they attended a funeral. They made a coffin, and they must have been 
                    growing a huge tomato because they put it in the coffin. And then they marched to the council with a band playing 
                    funeral music.”

                <p>
                    The theatrical protest worked. By 1959, the council lifted the ban, though not without introducing new rules—including 
                    a strict one-hour time limit on the tomato-throwing chaos. Over the decades, La Tomatina’s fame continued to grow.

                    And in 2002, the Spanish secretary of the department of tourism named it an official Festivity of International Tourist 
                    Interest—cementing its place as one of the country’s most iconic and beloved celebrations.

                    Each August, thousands of tourists join the 9,000 residents of Buñol for the world’s biggest food fight. The event has 
                    grown so wildly popular that, in 2013, organizers required tickets and capped attendance at 20,000. Revelers now travel 
                    from all corners of the globe to attend the pulpy spectacle.
